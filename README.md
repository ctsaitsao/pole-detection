# Object Detection in Point Cloud: Poles
### Authors: Christopher Tsai, Anuj Karnik
Final project for EE 495: Geospatial Vision and Visualization, Northwestern University, Spring 2020.

## Introduction
Object detection in point cloud is popular in HD Maps and sensor-based autonomous driving. In this project, street poles (lampposts) were detected from an aerial view point cloud.

## Input


## Methodology


## Usage
1. Install the following required libraries in Anaconda under Python3:
   ```
   conda install -c open3d-admin open3d
   conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
   conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib 
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to implement the point cloud data processing and pole segmentation.

## Result
